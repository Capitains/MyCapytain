                            because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter 
                            consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or 
                            pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because 
                            occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some 
                            great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious 
                            physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right

                            or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?
