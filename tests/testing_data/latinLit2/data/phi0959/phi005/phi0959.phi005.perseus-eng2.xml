					<l n="1">The title of this book when Cupid spied,<note anchored="true" place="foot" resp="ed">The author endeavors, in this treatise, to make amends for the
							hurt he did in the former and proposes several remedies in the case of
							love; some of which are very good and useful as there are others very
							trivial, and not fit to be put in practice. <placeName key="tgn,2025973">Ovid</placeName> begins this treatise as agreeably as he has done
							the others, and, indeed, his invention is so fruitful that he never
							wants grace. Cupid seems frightened at the title of it, apprehending he
							is declaring war against him.</note></l>
					<l n="2">"Treason! a plot against our state," he cried.</l>
					<l n="3">Why should you thus your loyal poet wrong,<note anchored="true" place="foot" resp="ed">No man understood the affairs of gallantry better than
							Ovid.</note></l>
					<l n="4">Who in your war has serv'd so well and long?</l>
					<l n="5">So savage and ill-bred I ne'er can prove,</l>
					<l n="6">Like Diomede, to wound the queen of love.</l>
					<l n="7">Others by fits have felt your am'rous flame,</l>
					<l n="8">I still have been, and still your martyr am;</l>
					<l n="9">Rules for your vot'ries I did late impart.</l>
					<l n="10">Refining passion, and made love an art.</l>
					<l n="11">Nor do I now of that or thee take leave,</l>
					<l n="12">Nor does the muse her former web unweave.</l>
					<l n="13">Let him who loves, where love success may find,</l>
					<l n="14">Spread all his sails before the prosp'rous wind;</l>
					<l n="15">But let poor youths who female scorn endure,</l>
					<l n="16">And hopeless burn, repair to me for cure:</l>
					<l n="17">For why should any worthy youth destroy</l>
					<l n="18">Himself, because some worthless nymph is coy?</l>
					<l n="19">Love should be nature's friend; let hemp and steel</l>
					<l n="20">Hangmen and heroes use, whose trade's to kill.</l>
					<l n="21">Where fatal it would prove, let passion cease;</l>
					<l n="22">Nor love destroy, who should our race increase.</l>
					<l n="23">A child you are, and like a child should play;</l>
					<l n="24">And gentle as your years should be your sway.</l>
					<l n="25">Keen arrows, and to wound the hardest hearts,</l>
					<l n="26">You are permitted-but no mortal darts.</l>

					<l n="29">You should your mother's milder laws observe,</l>
					<l n="30">Who ne'er did childless parent's curse deserve;</l>
					<l n="31">Or if you must employ your wanton pow'r,</l>
					<l n="32">Teach youths by night to force their mistress' door:</l>
					<l n="33">How lovers safe and secretly may meet,</l>
					<l n="34">And subtle wives the cautious husband cheat.</l>
					<l n="35">Let now th' excluded youth the gate caress,</l>
					<l n="36">A thousand wheedling soothing plaints express;</l>
					<l n="37">Then on th' ill-natur'd timber vent his spite,</l>
					<l n="38">And to some doleful tune weep out the night.</l>
					<l n="39">For tears, not blood, love's altar should require:</l>
					<l n="40">Love's torch, design'd to kindle kind desire,</l>
					<l n="41">Must seem profan'd to light a fun'ral fire."</l>

							was found by shepherds, who carried him to Corytus, king of <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>, by whom he was adopted for a
							son. When he had grown up to man's estate, he went to Delphos to enquire
							out his parents by the oracle, which bid him go to Theutras, kingn of
								<placeName key="tgn,7016748">Mysia</placeName>, where he should be
							informed of what he desired; he then found his mother Auge, and when his
							birth was known, great was the joy of the Mysian court. Theytras, who
							had no male issue, gave him his daughter Argiope in marriage and left
							him his successor in the kingdom at his death. The Trojan war happening
							nsome time after, the Greeks who did not know very well their way to
								<placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, landed in <placeName key="tgn,7016748">Mysia</placeName>, where Telephus gave them
							battle, and wounded Ulysses; but was himself dangerously wounded by
							Achilles. Consulting the oracle about his cure, he was told he could
							never be cured, unless he was wounded again in the same place with the
							same lance; upon which he went to <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, whither the Greeks were returned, and promised
							Achilles to be his guide to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> if he would cure him; accordingly the Grecian hero
							did cure him with the same lance that gave the wound. Diodorus Siculus
							tells this story in his fifth book.</note></l>
					<l n="51">The Pelian spear that wounded, made him sound.</l>
