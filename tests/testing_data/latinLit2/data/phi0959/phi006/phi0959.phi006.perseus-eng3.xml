<l n="7">Before the ocean and the earth appeared—</l>
<l n="8">before the skies had overspread them all—</l>
<l n="9">the face of Nature in a vast expanse</l>
<l n="10">was naught but Chaos uniformly waste.</l>
<l n="11">It was a rude and undeveloped mass,</l>
<l n="12">that nothing made except a ponderous weight;</l>
<l n="13">and all discordant elements confused,</l>
<l n="14">were there congested in a shapeless heap.</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="15">As yet the sun afforded earth no light,</l>
<l n="16">nor did the moon renew her crescent horns;</l>
<l n="17">the earth was not suspended in the air</l>
<l n="18">exactly balanced by her heavy weight.</l>
<l n="19">Not far along the margin of the shores</l>
<l n="20">had Amphitrite stretched her lengthened arms,—</l>
<l n="21">for all the land was mixed with sea and air.</l>
<l n="22">The land was soft, the sea unfit to sail,</l>
<l n="23">the atmosphere opaque, to naught was given</l>
<l n="24">a proper form, in everything was strife,</l>
<l n="25">and all was mingled in a seething mass—</l>
<l n="26">with hot the cold parts strove, and wet with dry</l>
<l n="27">and soft with hard, and weight with empty void.</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="28">But God, or kindly Nature, ended strife—</l>
<l n="29">he cut the land from skies, the sea from land,</l>
<l n="30">the heavens ethereal from material air;</l>
<l n="31">and when were all evolved from that dark mass</l>
<l n="32">he bound the fractious parts in tranquil peace.</l>
<l n="33">The fiery element of convex heaven</l>
<l n="34">leaped from the mass devoid of dragging weight,</l>
<l n="35">and chose the summit arch to which the air</l>
<l n="36">as next in quality was next in place.</l>
<l n="37">The earth more dense attracted grosser parts</l>
<l n="38">and moved by gravity sank underneath;</l>
<l n="39">and last of all the wide surrounding waves</l>
<l n="40">in deeper channels rolled around the globe.</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="41">And when this God —which one is yet unknown—</l>
<l n="42">had carved asunder that discordant mass,</l>
<l n="43">had thus reduced it to its elements,</l>
<l n="44">that every part should equally combine,</l>
<l n="45">when time began He rounded out the earth</l>
<l n="46">and moulded it to form a mighty globe.</l>
<l n="47">Then poured He forth the deeps and gave command</l>
<l n="48">that they should billow in the rapid winds,</l>
<l n="49">that they should compass every shore of earth. </l>
<l n="50">he also added fountains, pools and lakes,</l>
<l n="51">and bound with shelving banks the slanting streams,</l>
<l n="52">which partly are absorbed and partly join</l>
<l n="53">the boundless ocean. Thus received amid</l>
<l n="54">the wide expanse of uncontrolled waves,</l>
<l n="55">they beat the shores instead of crooked banks.</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="56">At His command the boundless plains extend,</l>
<l n="57">the valleys are depressed, the woods are clothed</l>
<l n="58">in green, the stony mountains rise. And as</l>
<l n="59">the heavens are intersected on the right</l>
<l n="60">by two broad zones, by two that cut the left,</l>
<l n="61">and by a fifth consumed with ardent heat,</l>
<l n="62">with such a number did the careful God</l>
<l n="63">mark off the compassed weight, and thus the earth</l>
<l n="64">received as many climes.—Such heat consumes</l>
<l n="65">the middle zone that none may dwell therein;</l>
<l n="66">and two extremes are covered with deep snow;</l>
<l n="67">and two are placed betwixt the hot and cold,</l>
<l n="68">which mixed together give a temperate clime;</l>
<l n="69">and over all the atmosphere suspends</l>
<l n="70">with weight proportioned to the fiery sky,</l>
<l n="71">exactly as the weight of earth compares</l>
<l n="72">with weight of water.</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="73">And He ordered mist</l>
<l n="74">to gather in the air and spread the clouds.</l>
<l n="75">He fixed the thunders that disturb our souls,</l>
<l n="76">and brought the lightning on destructive winds</l>
<l n="77">that also waft the cold. Nor did the great</l>
<l n="78">Artificer permit these mighty winds</l>
<l n="79">to blow unbounded in the pathless skies,</l>
<l n="80">but each discordant brother fixed in space,</l>
<l n="81">although His power can scarce restrain their rage</l>
<l n="82">to rend the universe. At His command</l>
<l n="83">to far Aurora, Eurus took his way,</l>
<l n="84">to Nabath, <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName>, and that mountain range</l>
<l n="85">first gilded by the dawn; and Zephyr's flight</l>
<l n="86">was towards the evening star and peaceful shores,</l>
<l n="87">warm with the setting sun; and Boreas</l>
<l n="88">invaded <placeName key="tgn,6005315">Scythia</placeName> and the northern snows;</l>
<l n="89">and Auster wafted to the distant south</l>
<l n="90">where clouds and rain encompass his abode.—</l>
<l n="91">and over these He fixed the liquid sky,</l>
<l n="92">devoid of weight and free from earthly dross.</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="93">And scarcely had He separated these</l>
<l n="94">and fixed their certain bounds, when all the stars,</l>
<l n="95">which long were pressed and hidden in the mass,</l>
<l n="96">began to gleam out from the plains of heaven,</l>
<l n="97">and traversed, with the Gods, bright ether fields:</l>
<l n="98">and lest some part might be bereft of life</l>
<l n="99">the gleaming waves were filled with twinkling fish;</l>
<l n="100">the earth was covered with wild animals;</l>
<l n="101">the agitated air was filled with birds. </l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="102">But one more perfect and more sanctified,</l>
<l n="103">a being capable of lofty thought,</l>
<l n="104">intelligent to rule, was wanting still</l>
<l n="105">man was created! Did the Unknown God</l>
<l n="106">designing then a better world make man</l>
<l n="107">of seed divine? or did Prometheus</l>
<l n="108">take the new soil of earth (that still contained</l>
<l n="109">some godly element of Heaven's Life)</l>
<l n="110">and use it to create the race of man;</l>
<l n="111">first mingling it with water of new streams;</l>
<l n="112">so that his new creation, upright man,</l>
<l n="113">was made in image of commanding Gods?</l>
<l n="114">On earth the brute creation bends its gaze,</l>
<l n="115">but man was given a lofty countenance</l>
<l n="116">and was commanded to behold the skies;</l>
<l n="117">and with an upright face may view the stars:—</l>
<l n="118">and so it was that shapeless clay put on</l>
<l n="119">the form of man till then unknown to earth.</l>

<l n="120">First was the Golden Age. Then rectitude</l>
<l n="121">spontaneous in the heart prevailed, and faith.</l>
<l n="122">Avengers were not seen, for laws unframed</l>
<l n="123">were all unknown and needless. Punishment</l>
<l n="124">and fear of penalties existed not.</l>
<l n="125">No harsh decrees were fixed on brazen plates.</l>
<l n="126">No suppliant multitude the countenance</l>
<l n="127">of Justice feared, averting, for they dwelt</l>
<l n="128">without a judge in peace. Descended not</l>
<l n="129">the steeps, shorn from its height, the lofty pine,</l>
<l n="130">cleaving the trackless waves of alien shores,</l>
<l n="131">nor distant realms were known to wandering men.</l>
<l n="132">The towns were not entrenched for time of war;</l>
<l n="133">they had no brazen trumpets, straight, nor horns</l>
<l n="134">of curving brass, nor helmets, shields nor swords.</l>
<l n="135">There was no thought of martial pomp —secure</l>
<l n="136">a happy multitude enjoyed repose.</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="137">Then of her own accord the earth produced</l>
<l n="138">a store of every fruit. The harrow touched</l>
<l n="139">her not, nor did the plowshare wound</l>
<l n="140">her fields. And man content with given food,</l>
<l n="141">and none compelling, gathered arbute fruits</l>
<l n="142">and wild strawberries on the mountain sides,</l>
<l n="143">and ripe blackberries clinging to the bush,</l>
<l n="144">and corners and sweet acorns on the ground,</l>
<l n="145">down fallen from the spreading tree of Jove.</l>
<l n="146">Eternal Spring! Soft breathing zephyrs soothed</l>
<l n="147">and warmly cherished buds and blooms, produced</l>
<l n="148">without a seed. The valleys though unplowed</l>
<l n="149">gave many fruits; the fields though not renewed</l>
<l n="150">white glistened with the heavy bearded wheat:</l>
<l n="151">rivers flowed milk and nectar, and the trees,</l>
<l n="152">the very oak trees, then gave honey of themselves.</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="153">When Saturn had been banished into night</l>
<l n="154">and all the world was ruled by Jove supreme,</l>
<l n="155">the Silver Age, though not so good as gold</l>
<l n="156">but still surpassing yellow brass, prevailed.</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="157">Jove first reduced to years the Primal Spring,</l>
<l n="158">by him divided into periods four,</l>
<l n="159">unequal,—summer, autumn, winter, spring.—</l>
<l n="160">then glowed with tawny heat the parched air,</l>
<l n="161">or pendent icicles in winter froze</l>
<l n="162">and man stopped crouching in crude caverns, while</l>
<l n="163">he built his homes of tree rods, bark entwined.</l>
<l n="164">Then were the cereals planted in long rows,</l>
<l n="165">and bullocks groaned beneath the heavy yoke.</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="166">The third Age followed, called The Age of Bronze,</l>
<l n="167">when cruel people were inclined to arms</l>
<l n="168">but not to impious crimes. And last of all</l>
<l n="169">the ruthless and hard Age of Iron prevailed,</l>
<l n="170">from which malignant vein great evil sprung;</l>
<l n="171">and modesty and faith and truth took flight,</l>
<l n="172">and in their stead deceits and snares and frauds</l>
<l n="173">and violence and wicked love of gain,</l>
<l n="174">succeeded.—Then the sailor spread his sails</l>
<l n="175">to winds unknown, and keels that long had stood</l>
<l n="176">on lofty mountains pierced uncharted waves.</l>
<l n="177">Surveyors anxious marked with metes and bounds</l>
<l n="178">the lands, created free as light and air:</l>
<l n="179">nor need the rich ground furnish only crops,</l>
<l n="180">and give due nourishment by right required,—</l>
<l n="181">they penetrated to the bowels of earth</l>
<l n="182">and dug up wealth, bad cause of all our ills,—</l>
<l n="183">rich ores which long ago the earth had hid</l>
<l n="184">and deep removed to gloomy Stygian caves:</l>
<l n="185">and soon destructive iron and harmful gold</l>
<l n="186">were brought to light; and War, which uses both,</l>
<l n="187">came forth and shook with sanguinary grip</l>
<l n="188">his clashing arms. Rapacity broke forth—</l>
<l n="189">the guest was not protected from his host,</l>
<l n="190">the father in law from his own son in law;</l>
<l n="191">even brothers seldom could abide in peace.</l>
<l n="192">The husband threatened to destroy his wife,</l>
<l n="193">and she her husband: horrid step dames mixed</l>
<l n="194">the deadly henbane: eager sons inquired</l>
<l n="195">their fathers, ages. Piety was slain:</l>
<l n="196">and last of all the virgin deity,</l>

<milestone ed="More" n="GIANTS" unit="tale"/>
<l n="198">And lest ethereal heights should long remain</l>
<l n="199">less troubled than the earth, the throne of Heaven</l>
<l n="200">was threatened by the Giants;   and they piled</l>
<l n="201">mountain on mountain to the lofty stars.</l>
<l n="202">But Jove, omnipotent, shot thunderbolts</l>
<l n="203">through <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Mount Olympus</placeName>, and he overturned</l>

<l n="205">And while these dreadful bodies lay overwhelmed</l>
<l n="206">in their tremendous bulk, (so fame reports)</l>
<l n="207">the Earth was reeking with the copious blood</l>
<l n="208">of her gigantic sons; and thus replete</l>
<l n="209">with moisture she infused the steaming gore</l>
<l n="210">with life renewed. So that a monument</l>
<l n="211">of such ferocious stock should be retained,</l>
<l n="212">she made that offspring in the shape of man;  </l>
<l n="213">but this new race alike despised the Gods,</l>

<l n="">Now <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> had not revealed himself,</l>

<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="">But not aware of this, her father bade</l>
<l n="">her brother Cadmus search through all the world,</l>
<l n="">until he found his sister, and proclaimed</l>
<l n="">him doomed to exile if he found her not;—</l>
<l n="">thus was he good and wicked in one deed.</l>
<l n="">When he had vainly wandered over the earth</l>
<l n="">(for who can fathom the deceits of Jove?)</l>
<l n="">Cadmus, the son of King Agenor, shunned</l>
<l n="">his country and his father's mighty wrath.</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="">But he consulted the famed oracles</l>
<l n="">of Phoebus, and enquired of them what land</l>
<l n="">might offer him a refuge and a home.</l>
<l n="">And Phoebus answered him; “When on the plains</l>
<l n="">a heifer, that has never known the yoke,</l>
<l n="">shall cross thy path go thou thy way with her,</l>
<l n="">and follow where she leads; and when she lies,</l>
<l n="">to rest herself upon the meadow green,</l>
<l n="">there shalt thou stop, as it will be a sign</l>
<l n="">for thee to build upon that plain the walls</l>
<l n="">of a great city: and its name shall be</l>
<l n="">the City of <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>.”</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="">Cadmus turned;</l>
<l n="">but hardly had descended from the cave,</l>
<l n="">Castalian, ere he saw a heifer go</l>
<l n="">unguarded, gentle-paced, without the scars</l>
<l n="">of labour on her neck. He followed close</l>
<l n="">upon her steps (and silently adored</l>
<l n="">celestial Phoebus, author of his way)</l>
<l n="">till over the channel that Cephissus wears</l>
<l n="">he forded to the fields of Panope</l>
<l n="">and even over to <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>.—</l>
<l n="">there stood the slow-paced heifer, and she raised</l>
<l n="">her forehead, broad with shapely horns, towards Heaven;</l>
<l n="">and as she filled the air with lowing, stretched</l>
<l n="">her side upon the tender grass, and turned</l>
<l n="">her gaze on him who followed in her path.</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="">Cadmus gave thanks and kissed the foreign soil,</l>
<l n="">and offered salutation to the fields</l>
<l n="">and unexplored hills. Then he prepared</l>
<l n="">to make large sacrifice to <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName>,</l>
<l n="">and ordered slaves to seek the living springs</l>
<l n="">whose waters in libation might be poured.</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="">There was an ancient grove, whose branching trees</l>
<l n="">had never known the desecrating ax,</l>
<l n="">where hidden in the undergrowth a cave,</l>
<l n="">with oziers bending round its low-formed arch,</l>
<l n="">was hollowed in the jutting rocks—deep-found</l>
<l n="">in the dark center of that hallowed grove—</l>
<l n="">beneath its arched roof a beauteous stream</l>
<l n="">of water welled serene. Its gloom concealed</l>
<l n="">a dragon, sacred to the war-like Mars;</l>
<l n="">crested and gorgeous with radescent scales,</l>
<l n="">and eyes that sparkled as the glow of coals.</l>
<l n="">A deadly venom had puffed up his bulk,</l>
<l n="">and from his jaws he darted forth three tongues,</l>
<l n="">and in a triple row his sharp teeth stood.</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="">Now those who ventured of the Tyrian race,</l>
<l n="">misfortuned followers of Cadmus, took</l>
<l n="">the path that led them to this grove; and when</l>
<l n="">they cast down-splashing in the springs an urn,</l>
<l n="">the hidden dragon stretched his azure head</l>
<l n="">out from the cavern's gloom, and vented forth</l>
<l n="">terrific hissings. Horrified they dropped</l>
<l n="">their urns. A sudden trembling shook their knees;</l>
<l n="">and their life-blood was ice within their veins.</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="">The dragon wreathed his scales in rolling knots,</l>
<l n="">and with a spring, entwisted in great folds,</l>
<l n="">reared up his bulk beyond the middle rings,</l>
<l n="">high in the air from whence was given his gaze</l>
<l n="">the extreme confines of the grove below.</l>
<l n="">A size prodigious, his enormous bulk,</l>
<l n="">if seen extended where was naught to hide,</l>
<l n="">would rival in its length the Serpent's folds,</l>
<l n="">involved betwixt the planes of the Twin Bears.</l>
<l n="">The terrified Phoenicians, whether armed</l>
<l n="">for conflict, or in flight precipitate,</l>
<l n="">or whether held incapable from fear,</l>
<l n="">he seized with sudden rage; stung them to death,</l>
<l n="">or crushed them in the grasp of crushing folds,</l>
<l n="">or blasted with the poison of his breath.</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="">High in the Heavens the sun small shadow made</l>
<l n="">when Cadmus, wondering what detained his men,</l>
<l n="">prepared to follow them. Clothed in a skin</l>
<l n="">torn from a lion, he was armed, complete,</l>
<l n="">with lance of glittering steel; and with a dart:</l>
<l n="">but passing these he had a dauntless soul.</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="">When he explored the grove and there beheld</l>
<l n="">the lifeless bodies, and above them stretched</l>
<l n="">the vast victorious dragon licking up</l>
<l n="">the blood that issued from their ghastly wounds;</l>
<l n="">his red tongues dripping gore; then Cadmus filled</l>
<l n="">with rage and grief; “Behold, my faithful ones!</l>
<l n="">I will avenge your deaths or I will share it!”</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="">He spoke; and lifted up a mill-stone huge,</l>
<l n="">in his right hand, and having poised it, hurled</l>
<l n="">with a tremendous effort dealing such</l>
<l n="">a blow would crush the strongest builded walls;</l>
<l n="">yet neither did the dragon flinch the shock</l>
<l n="">nor was he wounded, for his armour-scales,</l>
<l n="">fixed in his hard and swarthy hide, repelled</l>
<l n="">the dreadful impact. Not the javelin thus,</l>
<l n="">so surely by his armoured skin was foiled,</l>
<l n="">for through the middle segment of his spine</l>
<l n="">the steel point pierced, and sank beneath the flesh,</l>
<l n="">deep in his entrails. Writhing in great pain</l>
<l n="">he turned his head upon his bleeding back,</l>
<l n="">twisting the shaft, with force prodigious shook</l>
<l n="">it back and forth, and wrenched it from the wound;</l>
<l n="">with difficulty wrenched it. But the steel</l>
<l n="">remained securely fastened in his bones.</l>
<l n="">Such agony but made increase of rage:</l>
<l n="">his throat was swollen with great knotted veins;</l>
<l n="">a white froth gathered on his poisonous jaws;</l>
<l n="">the earth resounded with his rasping scales;</l>
<l n="">he breathed upon the grass a pestilence,</l>
<l n="">steaming mephitic from his Stygian mouth.</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="">His body writhes up in tremendous gyres;</l>
<l n="">his folds, now straighter than a beam, untwist;</l>
<l n="">he rushes forward on his vengeful foe,</l>
<l n="">his great breast crushing the deep-rooted trees.</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="">Small space gave Cadmus to the dragon's rage,</l>
<l n="">for by the lion's spoil he stood the shock,</l>
<l n="">and thrusting in his adversary's jaws</l>
<l n="">the trusted lance gave check his mad career.</l>
<l n="">Wild in his rage the dragon bit the steel</l>
<l n="">and fixed his teeth on the keen-biting point:</l>
<l n="">out from his poisoned palate streams of gore</l>
<l n="">spouted and stained the green with sanguine spray.</l>
<l n="">Yet slight the wound for he recoiled in time,</l>
<l n="">and drew his wounded body from the spear;</l>
<l n="">by shrinking from the sharp steel saved his throat</l>
<l n="">a mortal wound. But Cadmus as he pressed</l>
<l n="">the spear-point deeper in the serpent's throat,</l>
<l n="">pursued him till an oak-tree barred the way;</l>
<l n="">to this he fixed the dragon through the neck:</l>
<l n="">the stout trunk bending with the monster's weight,</l>
<l n="">groaned at the lashing of his serpent tail.</l>

<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="">While the brave victor gazed upon the bulk</l>

<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="">art thou here standing by this carcase-worm,</l>
<l n="">for others shall behold thy body changed</l>
<l n="">into a serpent?” Terrified, amazed,</l>

<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="">But lo, the hero's watchful Deity,</l>
<l n=""><placeName key="tgn,2516785">Minerva</placeName>, from the upper realms of air</l>
<l n="">appeared before him. She commanded him</l>
<l n="">to sow the dragon's teeth in mellowed soil,</l>
<l n="">from which might spring another race of men.</l>
<l n="">And he obeyed: and as he plowed the land,</l>
<l n="">took care to scatter in the furrowed soil</l>
<l n="">the dragon's teeth; a seed to raise up man.</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="">'Tis marvelous but true, when this was done</l>
<l n="">the clods began to move. A spear-point first</l>
<l n="">appeared above the furrows, followed next</l>
<l n="">by helmet-covered heads, nodding their cones;</l>
<l n="">their shoulders, breasts and arms weighted with spears;</l>
<l n="">and largely grew the shielded crop of men.—</l>
<l n="">so is it in the joyful theaters</l>
<l n="">when the gay curtains, rolling from the floor,</l>
<l n="">are upward drawn until the scene is shown,—</l>
<l n="">it seems as if the figures rise to view:</l>
<l n="">first we behold their faces, then we see</l>

<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n=""><placeName key="tgn,2213929">Cadmus</placeName>, affrighted by this host, prepared</l>

<l n="">he smote an earth-born brother, hand to hand;</l>

<l n="">pierced by a dart some distant brother hurled;</l>

<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="">There is a valley called</l>

<l n="">was hollowed in frail sandstone and the soft</l>

<l n="">Hapless Actaeon's end in various ways</l>

<l n="">Am I not <placeName key="tgn,2075297">Juno</placeName> the supreme of Heaven?</l>

<l n="">sister and wife of Jove omnipotent?</l>
<l n="">She even wishes to be known by him</l>

<l n="">old <placeName key="tgn,1026962">Beroe</placeName>, an Epidaurian nurse,</l>

<l n="">(doubtful that <placeName key="tgn,2019952">Jupiter</placeName> could be her love)—</l>

<l n="">“When Jove appears to pledge his love to you,</l>
<l n="">implore him to assume his majesty</l>
<l n="">and all his glory, even as he does</l>
<l n="">in presence of his stately Juno—Yea,</l>
<l n="">implore him to caress you as a God.”</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="">With artful words as these the goddess worked</l>
<l n="">upon the trusting mind of Semele,</l>
<l n="">daughter of <placeName key="tgn,2078692">Cadmus</placeName>, till she begged of Jove</l>
<l n="">a boon, that only hastened her sad death;</l>
<l n="">for Jove not knowing her design replied,</l>

<l n="">All overjoyed at her misfortune, proud</l>

<l n="">before he knew her quest the words were said;</l>
<l n="">and, knowing that his greatest oath was pledged,</l>
<l n="">he sadly mounted to the lofty skies,</l>

<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n=""><placeName key="tgn,2075297">Juno</placeName> confused</l>

<l n="">had made escape adown a mountain. But</l>

<l n="">the glorious <placeName key="tgn,2075297">Juno</placeName>, when she knew her guile;</l>

<l n="">“Your tongue, so freely wagged at my expense,</l>

<l n="">was stricken as the goddess had decreed;—</l>
<l n="">and, ever since, she only mocks the sounds</l>

<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="">One day, when she observed</l>

<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="">Presently the youth,</l>
<l n="">by chance divided from his trusted friends,</l>
<l n="">cries loudly, “Who is here?” and Echo, “Here!”</l>
<l n="">Replies. Amazed, he casts his eyes around,</l>
<l n="">and calls with louder voice, “Come here!” “Come here!”</l>
<l n="">She calls the youth who calls.—He turns to see</l>

<l n="">“Avoid me not!” “Avoid me not!” returns.</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="">He tries again, again, and is deceived</l>

<l n="">“Oh let us come together!” Echo cries,</l>

<l n="">seemed sweeter to the Nymph, and from the woods</l>
<l n="">she hastens in accordance with her words,</l>
<l n="">and strives to wind her arms around his neck.</l>
<l n="">He flies from her and as he leaves her says,</l>
<l n="">“Take off your hands! you shall not fold your arms</l>

<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="">But her great love increases with neglect;</l>
<l n="">her miserable body wastes away,</l>

<l n="">her voice continues, in the wilderness;</l>
<l n="">her bones have turned to stone. She lies concealed</l>

<l n="">There was a fountain silver-clear and bright,</l>

<l n="">a thing of life to love. He cannot move,</l>
<l n="">for so he marvels at himself, and lies</l>

<l n="">a statue carved of Parian marble. Long,</l>

<l n="">dreaming in sweetness, his complexion fair</l>
<l n="">and blushing as the rose in snow-drift white.</l>
<l n="">All that is lovely in himself he loves,</l>

<l n="">The cheat that you are seeking has no place.</l>
<l n="">Avert your gaze and you will lose your love,</l>

<l n="">he is himself undone. Raising himself</l>
<l n="">a moment, he extends his arms around,</l>
<l n="">and, beckoning to the murmuring forest; “Oh,</l>
<l n="">ye aisled wood was ever man in love</l>
<l n="">more fatally than I? Your silent paths</l>
<l n="">have sheltered many a one whose love was told,</l>
<l n="">and ye have heard their voices. Ages vast</l>

<l n="">but who is he through all those weary years</l>
<l n="">that ever pined away as I? Alas,</l>
<l n="">this fatal image wins my love, as I</l>
<l n="">behold it. But I cannot press my arms</l>
<l n="">around the form I see, the form that gives</l>
<l n="">me joy. What strange mistake has intervened</l>
<l n="">betwixt us and our love? It grieves me more</l>
<l n="">that neither lands nor seas nor mountains, no,</l>
<l n="">nor walls with closed gates deny our loves,</l>
<l n="">but only a little water keeps us far</l>
<l n="">asunder. Surely he desires my love</l>
<l n="">and my embraces, for as oft I strive</l>
<l n="">to kiss him, bending to the limpid stream</l>
<l n="">my lips, so often does he hold his face</l>
<l n="">fondly to me, and vainly struggles up.</l>
<l n="">It seems that I could touch him. 'Tis a strange</l>
<l n="">delusion that is keeping us apart.</l>

<l n="">“Whoever thou art, Come up! Deceive me not!</l>
<l n="">Oh, whither when I fain pursue art thou?</l>

<l n="">have seen thy tears, and every sign I make</l>
<l n="">thou cost return; and often thy sweet lips</l>
<l n="">have seemed to move, that, peradventure words,</l>
<l n="">which I have never heard, thou hast returned.</l>

<l n="">“No more my shade deceives me, I perceive</l>
<l n="">'Tis I in thee—I love myself—the flame</l>

<l n="">what shall I do? Shall I at once implore?</l>
<l n="">Or should I linger till my love is sought?</l>
<l n="">What is it I implore? The thing that I</l>
<l n="">desire is mine—abundance makes me poor.</l>
<l n="">Oh, I am tortured by a strange desire</l>
<l n="">unknown to me before, for I would fain</l>
<l n="">put off this mortal form; which only means</l>
<l n="">I wish the object of my love away.</l>
<l n="">Grief saps my strength, the sands of life are run,</l>

<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="">He spoke; and crazed with love,</l>
<l n="">returned to view the same face in the pool;</l>
<l n="">and as he grieved his tears disturbed the stream,</l>

<l n="">defaced his mirrored form. And thus the youth,</l>
<l n="">when he beheld that lovely shadow go;</l>
<l n="">“Ah whither cost thou fly? Oh, I entreat</l>
<l n="">thee leave me not. Alas, thou cruel boy</l>
<l n="">thus to forsake thy lover. Stay with me</l>
<l n="">that I may see thy lovely form, for though</l>

<l n="">he rent his garment from the upper edge,</l>
<l n="">and beating on his naked breast, all white</l>
<l n="">as marble, every stroke produced a tint</l>
<l n="">as lovely as the apple streaked with red,</l>

<l n="">in early morning 'neath the genial sun;</l>
<l n="">so did he pine away, by love consumed,</l>

<l n="">No vermeil bloom now mingled in the white</l>

<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="">His Naiad sisters mourned, and having clipped</l>

<l n="">thine eyes, most fortunate, should not behold</l>
<l n="">the Bacchanalian rites! The day will come,</l>
<l n="">and soon the light will dawn, when <placeName key="tgn,2097807">Bacchus</placeName>, born</l>

<l n="">all hail the new god <placeName key="tgn,2097807">Bacchus</placeName>! Either thou</l>
<l n="">must build a temple to this Deity,</l>
<l n="">or shalt be torn asunder; thy remains,</l>
<l n="">throughout the forest scattered, will pollute</l>
<l n="">the wood with sanguinary streams; and thy</l>
<l n="">life-blood bespatter with corrupting blots</l>
<l n="">thy frenzied mother and her sisters twain.</l>
<l n="">And all shall come to pass, as I have told,</l>
<l n="">because thou wilt not honour the New God.</l>
<l n="">And thou shalt wail and marvel at the sight</l>
<l n="">of blind Tiresias, though veiled in night.”</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="">And as he spoke, lo, Pentheus drove the seer:</l>
<l n="">but all his words, prophetic, were fulfilled,</l>
<l n="">and confirmation followed in his steps.—</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n=""><placeName key="tgn,2097807">Bacchus</placeName> at once appears, and all the fields</l>

<l n="">nobles and commons and the most refined—</l>
<l n="">a motley multitude—resistless borne</l>
<l n="">to join those rites of <placeName key="tgn,2097807">Bacchus</placeName>, there begun.</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="">Then Pentheus cries; “What madness, O ye brave</l>
<l n="">descendants of the Dragon! Sons of <placeName key="tgn,2090583">Mars</placeName>!</l>
<l n="">What frenzy has confounded you? Can sounds</l>
<l n="">of clanging brass prevail; and pipes and horns,</l>
<l n="">and magical delusions, drunkenness,</l>
<l n="">and yelling women, and obscene displays,</l>
<l n="">and hollow drums, overcome you, whom the sword,</l>
<l n="">nor troops of war, nor trumpet could affright?</l>

<l n="">“How shall I wonder at these ancient men,</l>
<l n="">who, crossing boundless seas from distant <placeName key="tgn,7002862">Tyre</placeName>,</l>
<l n="">hither transferred their exiled Household Gods,</l>
<l n="">and founded a new <placeName key="tgn,7002862">Tyre</placeName>; but now are shorn,</l>
<l n="">and even as captives would be led away</l>
<l n="">without appeal to Mars? And, O young men,</l>
<l n="">of active prime whose vigor equals mine!</l>
<l n="">Cast down your ivy scepters; take up arms;</l>
<l n="">put on your helmets; strip your brows of leaves;</l>
<l n="">be mindful of the mighty stock you are,</l>
<l n="">and let your souls be animated with</l>
<l n="">the spirit of that dauntless dragon, which,</l>
<l n="">unaided, slew so many, and at last</l>
<l n="">died to defend his fountain and his lake.—</l>
<l n="">so ye may conquer in the hope of fame.</l>

<l n="">“He gave the brave to death, but with your arms</l>
<l n="">ye shall expel the worthless, and enhance</l>
<l n="">the glory of your land. If Fate decree</l>
<l n="">the fall of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, Oh, let the engines</l>
<l n="">of war and men pull down its walls, and let</l>
<l n="">the clash of steel and roaring flames resound.</l>
<l n="">Thus, blameless in great misery, our woes</l>
<l n="">would be the theme of lamentations, known</l>
<l n="">to story; and our tears would shame us not.</l>

<l n="">“But now an unarmed boy will conquer <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>:</l>
<l n="">a lad whom neither weapons, wars nor steeds</l>
<l n="">delight; whose ringlets reek with myrrh; adorned</l>
<l n="">with chaplets, purple and embroidered robes</l>
<l n="">of interwoven gold. Make way for me!</l>
<l n="">And I will soon compel him to confess</l>
<l n="">his father is assumed and all his rites</l>
<l n="">are frauds.</l>

<l n="">“If in days gone Acrisius</l>
<l n="">so held this vain god in deserved contempt,</l>
<l n="">and shut the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> gates against his face,</l>
<l n="">why, therefore, should not Pentheus close the gates</l>
<l n="">of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, with equal courage—Hence! Away!</l>
<l n="">Fetch the vile leader of these rioters</l>

<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="">Him to restrain his grandsire, Cadmus, strove;</l>
<l n="">and Athamas, and many of his trusted friends</l>
<l n="">united in vain efforts to rebuke</l>
<l n="">his reckless rage; but greater violence</l>
<l n="">was gained from every admonition.—</l>
<l n="">his rage increased the more it was restrained,</l>
<l n="">and injury resulted from his friends.</l>
<l n="">So have I seen a stream in open course,</l>
<l n="">run gently on its way with pleasant noise,</l>
<l n="">but whensoever logs and rocks detained,</l>
<l n="">it foamed, with violence increased, against</l>
<l n="">obstruction.</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="">Presently returning came</l>
<l n="">his servants stained with blood, to whom he said,</l>

<l n="">but we have taken his attendant lad,</l>
<l n="">the chosen servant of his sacred rites.”</l>
<l n="">And they delivered to the noble king,</l>
<l n="">a youth whose hands were lashed behind his back.</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="">Then Pentheus, terrible in anger, turned</l>
<l n="">his awful gaze upon the lad, and though</l>

<l n="">“Doomed to destruction, thou art soon to give</l>
<l n="">example to my people by thy death:</l>
<l n="">tell me thy name; what are thy parents called;</l>
<l n="">where is thy land; and wherefore art thou found</l>
<l n="">attendant on these Bacchanalian rites.”</l>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="card" n="580">
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="">But fearless he replied; “They call my name</l>
<l n="">Acoetes; and <placeName key="tgn,7016631">Maeonia</placeName> is the land</l>
<l n="">from whence I came. My parents were so poor,</l>
<l n="">my father left me neither fruitful fields,</l>
<l n="">tilled by the lusty ox, nor fleecy sheep,</l>
<l n="">nor lowing kine; for, he himself was poor,</l>
<l n="">and with his hook and line was wont to catch</l>
<l n="">the leaping fishes, landed by his rod.</l>
<l n="">His skill was all his wealth. And when to me</l>
<l n="">he gave his trade, he said, ‘You are the heir</l>
<l n="">of my employment, therefore unto you</l>
<l n="">all that is mine I give,’ and, at his death,</l>
<l n="">he left me nothing but the running waves. —</l>
<l n="">they are the sum of my inheritance.</l>

<l n="">“And, afterwhile, that I might not be bound</l>
<l n="">forever to my father's rocky shores,</l>
<l n="">I learned to steer the keel with dextrous hand;</l>
<l n="">and marked with watchful gaze the guiding stars;</l>
<l n="">the watery Constellation of the Goat,</l>
<l n="">Olenian, and the Bear, the Hyades,</l>
<l n="">the Pleiades, the houses of the winds,</l>
<l n="">and every harbour suitable for ships.</l>

<l n="">“So chanced it, as I made for <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>, first</l>
<l n="">I veered close to the shores of <placeName key="tgn,7002670">Chios</placeName>: there</l>
<l n="">I steered, by plying on the starboard oar,</l>
<l n="">and nimbly leaping gained the sea-wet strand.</l>

<l n="">“Now when the night was past and lovely dawn</l>
<l n="">appeared, I,rose from slumber, and I bade</l>
<l n="">my men to fetch fresh water, and I showed</l>
<l n="">the pathway to the stream. Then did I climb</l>
<l n="">a promontory's height, to learn from there</l>
<l n="">the promise of the winds; which having done,</l>
<l n="">I called the men and sought once more my ship.</l>
<l n="">Opheltes, first of my companions, cried,</l>
<l n="">‘Behold we come!’ And, thinking he had caught</l>
<l n="">a worthy prize in that unfruitful land,</l>
<l n="">he led a boy, of virgin-beauty formed,</l>
<l n="">across the shore.</l>

<l n="">“Heavy with wine and sleep</l>
<l n="">the lad appeared to stagger on his way,—</l>
<l n="">with difficulty moving. When I saw</l>
<l n="">the manner of his dress, his countenance</l>
<l n="">and grace, I knew it was not mortal man,</l>
<l n="">and being well assured, I said to them;</l>
<l n="">‘What Deity abideth in that form</l>
<l n="">I cannot say; but 'tis a god in truth.—</l>
<l n="">O whosoever thou art, vouchsafe to us</l>
<l n="">propitious waters; ease our toils, and grant</l>
<l n="">to these thy grace.’</l>

<l n="">“At this, the one of all</l>
<l n="">my mariners who was the quickest hand,</l>
<l n="">who ever was the nimblest on the yards,</l>
<l n="">and first to slip the ropes, Dictys exclaimed;</l>
<l n="">‘Pray not for us!’ and all approved his words.</l>
<l n="">The golden haired, the guardian of the prow,</l>
<l n="">Melanthus, Libys and Alcimedon</l>
<l n="">approved it; and Epopeus who should urge</l>
<l n="">the flagging spirits, and with rhythmic chants</l>
<l n="">give time and measure to the beating oars,</l>
<l n="">and all the others praised their leader's words,—</l>
<l n="">so blind is greed of gain.—Then I rejoined,</l>
<l n="">‘Mine is the greatest share in this good ship,</l>
<l n="">which I will not permit to be destroyed,</l>
<l n="">nor injured by this sacred freight:’ and I</l>
<l n="">opposed them as they came.</l>

<l n="">“Then Lycabas,</l>
<l n="">the most audacious of that impious crew,</l>
<l n="">began to rage. He was a criminal,</l>
<l n="">who, for a dreadful murder, had been sent</l>
<l n="">in exile from a Tuscan city's gates.</l>
<l n="">Whilst I opposed he gripped me by the throat,</l>
<l n="">and shook me as would cast me in the deep,</l>
<l n="">had I not firmly held a rope, half stunned:</l>
<l n="">and all that wicked crew approved the deed.</l>

<l n="">“Then Bacchus (be assured it was the God)</l>
<l n="">as though the noise disturbed his lethargy</l>
<l n="">from wine, and reason had regained its power,</l>
<l n="">at last bespake the men, ‘What deeds are these?</l>
<l n="">What noise assails my ears? What means decoyed</l>
<l n="">my wandering footsteps? Whither do ye lead?’</l>
<l n="">‘Fear not,’ the steersman said, ‘but tell us fair</l>
<l n="">the haven of your hope, and you shall land</l>
<l n="">whereso your heart desires.’ ‘To <placeName key="tgn,7012053">Naxos</placeName> steer,’</l>
<l n="">Quoth Bacchus, ‘for it is indeed my home,</l>
<l n="">and there the mariner finds welcome cheer.’</l>
<l n="">Him to deceive, they pledged themselves, and swore</l>
<l n="">by Gods of seas and skies to do his will:</l>
<l n="">and they commanded me to steer that way.</l>

<l n="">“The Isle of <placeName key="tgn,7012053">Naxos</placeName> was upon our right;</l>
<l n="">and when they saw the sails were set that way,</l>
<l n="">they all began to shout at once, ‘What, ho!</l>
<l n="">Thou madman! what insanity is this,</l>
<l n="">Acoetes? Make our passage to the left.’</l>
<l n="">And all the while they made their meaning known</l>
<l n="">by artful signs or whispers in my ears.</l>

<l n="">“I was amazed and answered, ‘Take the helm.’</l>
<l n="">And I refused to execute their will,</l>
<l n="">atrocious, and at once resigned command.</l>
<l n="">Then all began to murmur, and the crew</l>
<l n="">reviled me. Up Aethalion jumped and said,</l>
<l n="">‘As if our only safety is in you!’</l>
<l n="">With this he swaggered up and took command;</l>
<l n="">and leaving <placeName key="tgn,7003909">Naxos</placeName> steered for other shores.</l>

<l n="">“Then Bacchus, mocking them,—as if but then</l>
<l n="">he had discovered their deceitful ways,—</l>
<l n="">looked on the ocean from the rounded stern,</l>
<l n="">and seemed to sob as he addressed the men;</l>
<l n="">‘Ah mariners, what alien shores are these?</l>
<l n="">'Tis not the land you promised nor the port</l>
<l n="">my heart desires. For what have I deserved</l>
<l n="">this cruel wrong? What honour can accrue</l>
<l n="">if strong men mock a boy; a lonely youth</l>
<l n="">if many should deceive?’ And as he spoke,</l>
<l n="">I, also, wept to see their wickedness.</l>

<l n="">“The impious gang made merry at our tears,</l>
<l n="">and lashed the billows with their quickening oars.</l>
<l n="">By Bacchus do I swear to you (and naught</l>
<l n="">celestial is more potent) all the things</l>
<l n="">I tell you are as true as they surpass</l>
<l n="">the limit of belief. The ship stood still</l>
<l n="">as if a dry dock held it in the sea.—</l>

<l n="">“The wondering sailors laboured at the oars,</l>
<l n="">and they unfurled the sails, in hopes to gain</l>
<l n="">some headway, with redoubled energies;</l>
<l n="">but twisting ivy tangled in the oars,</l>
<l n="">and interlacing held them by its weight.</l>
<l n="">And Bacchus in the midst of all stood crowned</l>
<l n="">with chaplets of grape-leaves, and shook a lance</l>
<l n="">covered with twisted fronds of leafy vines.</l>
<l n="">Around him crouched the visionary forms</l>
<l n="">of tigers, lynxes, and the mottled shapes</l>
<l n="">of panthers.</l>

<l n="">“Then the mariners leaped out,</l>
<l n="">possessed by fear or madness. Medon first</l>
<l n="">began to turn a swarthy hue, and fins</l>
<l n="">grew outward from his flattened trunk,</l>
<l n="">and with a curving spine his body bent.—</l>
<l n="">then Lycabas to him, ‘What prodigy</l>
<l n="">is this that I behold?’ Even as he spoke,</l>
<l n="">his jaws were broadened and his nose was bent;</l>
<l n="">his hardened skin was covered with bright scales.</l>
<l n="">And Libys, as he tried to pull the oars,</l>
<l n="">could see his own hands shrivel into fins;</l>
<l n="">another of the crew began to grasp</l>
<l n="">the twisted ropes, but even as he strove</l>
<l n="">to lift his arms they fastened to his sides;—</l>
<l n="">with bending body and a crooked back</l>
<l n="">he plunged into the waves, and as he swam</l>
<l n="">displayed a tail, as crescent as the moon.</l>

<l n="">“Now here, now there, they flounce about the ship;</l>
<l n="">they spray her decks with brine; they rise and sink;</l>
<l n="">they rise again, and dive beneath the waves;</l>
<l n="">they seem in sportive dance upon the main;</l>
<l n="">out from their nostrils they spout sprays of brine;</l>
<l n="">they toss their supple sides. And I alone,</l>
<l n="">of twenty mariners that manned that ship,</l>
<l n="">remained. A cold chill seized my limbs,—</l>
<l n="">I was so frightened; but the gracious God</l>
<l n="">now spake me fair, ‘Fear not and steer for <placeName key="tgn,7003909">Naxos</placeName>.’</l>
<l n="">And when we landed there I ministered</l>
<l n="">on smoking altars Bacchanalian rites.”</l>

<l n="">And while they fixed the instruments of death,</l>

<l n="">the legend says, though no one aided him,</l>
<l n="">the chains were loosened and slipped off his arms;</l>
<l n="">the doors flew open of their own accord.</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="">But Pentheus, long-persisting in his rage,</l>

<l n="">As when with sounding brass the trumpeter</l>

<l n="">the wrath of Pentheus and his rage enflame.</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="">About the middle of the mount (with groves</l>
<l n="">around its margin) was a treeless plain,</l>
<l n="">where nothing might conceal. Here as he stood</l>

<l n="">his mother saw him first. She was so wrought</l>
<l n="">with frenzy that she failed to know her son,</l>
<l n="">and cast her thyrsus that it wounded him;</l>
<l n="">and shouted, “Hi! come hither, Ho!</l>
<l n="">Come hither my two sisters! a great boar</l>

<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="">As he fled from them in fright</l>
<l n="">the raging multitude rushed after him;</l>
<l n="">and, as they gathered round; in cowardice</l>
<l n="">he cried for mercy and condemned himself,</l>
<l n="">confessing he had sinned against a God.</l>
<l n="">And as they wounded him he called his aunt;</l>
<l n="">“Autonoe have mercy! Let the shade</l>
<l n="">of sad Actaeon move thee to relent!”</l>
<l n="">No pity moved her when she heard that name;</l>
<l n="">in a wild frenzy she forgot her son.</l>
<l n="">While Pentheus was imploring her, she tore</l>
<l n="">his right arm out; her sister Ino wrenched</l>
<l n="">the other from his trunk. He could not stretch</l>
<l n="">his arms out to his mother, but he cried,</l>
<l n="">“Behold me, mother!” When Agave saw,</l>

<l n="">she clutched it with her blood-smeared fingers, while</l>
<l n="">she shouted, “Ho! companions! victory!</l>

<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="84">They wished to join in marriage, but that joy</l>
<l n="85">their fathers had forbidden them to hope;</l>
<l n="86">and yet the passion that with equal strength</l>

<l n="88">No relatives had guessed their secret love,</l>
<l n="89">for all their converse was by nods and signs;</l>
<l n="90">and as a smoldering fire may gather heat,</l>

<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="92">Now, it so happened, a partition built</l>

<l n="107">shouldst thou permit us to enjoy our love?</l>
<l n="108">But if we ask too much, let us persuade</l>

<l n="150">she found it on her way, and full of rage,</l>
<l n="151">tore it and stained it with her bloody jaws:</l>

<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="153">Now <placeName key="tgn,1122641">Pyramus</placeName> had not gone out so soon</l>

<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="184"><placeName key="perseus,Thisbe">Thisbe</placeName> returned,</l>

<l n="177">The sharp spear tore the victim's coat of mail</l>
